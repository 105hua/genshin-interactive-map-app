# Genshin Interactive Map App

The purpose of this application is very simple - to turn the
[Genshin Interactive Map App](https://genshin-impact-map.appsample.com/)
into a working Desktop Application. You may use this application if you feel
that having a Desktop Application for this type of thing is more convenient
than using your Browser.

## So, what does it do?

Behind the scenes, this application is very simple. It will open a new window
and load the Genshin Interactive Map inside of it. There is not really
anything *majorly fancy* going on. There are no added features or anything
along those lines, just an application made for your convenience :)

## Usage

*I will only provide releases for Windows. Feel free to build this*
*application from source, should you want to use a different OS :)*

It is very simple to get yourself setup with this application. The easiest
way is to head over to the Releases section of this Repository on the
right-hand side and download the Windows Setup Executable. Then, simply
run the setup file and the application will automatically install and open
itself. You are then free to use it as you wish :)

For those that may want to build it from source, please use the following
steps:

- Clone this repository into a directory of your choice.
- Then, run `npm install` to install all of the required dependencies.
- At this stage, you should then make any modifications to the code, if you
would like to.
- To start the application for debugging, run `npm run start`.
- To build the application for production, run `npm run make`.
- You should then be good to go!
